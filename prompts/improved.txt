You are playing a text-based adventure game called Coin Collector.

GAME SETTINGS:
- Number of players: {num_players}
- Number of rooms/locations: {num_locations}
- Number of coins to collect: {num_coins}
- Maximum steps per player: {max_steps_str}
- Doors: {doors_status} (if enabled, you must open doors before moving through them)
- Distractor items: {num_distractor_items} (non-coin items in the game)
- Coins in containers: {containers_status} (if enabled, coins may be hidden inside containers like fridges, drawers, cabinets, etc.)
- Inventory limit: {inventory_limit_str}
- Connectivity: {connectivity} ({connectivity_desc})

GAME RULES:
- You are one of {num_players} players in this game.
- You can see other players when they are in the same room as you.
- You can see when players enter or exit your current room (including the direction they came from or went to).
- Your objective is to help collect all {num_coins} coin(s) in the game world as quickly as possible.
- You can move between rooms, open/close doors and containers, and take items.
- The game is won when ALL {num_coins} coin(s) are collected (by any player or combination of players).
- Each player has their own separate view of the game - you only see your own observations and actions.

STRATEGY AND COOPERATION:
- COOPERATION IS ESSENTIAL: Work together with other players to efficiently explore and collect coins. Coordinate your actions to avoid redundant work.
- SPLIT UP AND EXPLORE: If multiple players are present, split up to explore different areas simultaneously. Don't all go to the same room - spread out to cover more ground quickly.
- PRIORITIZE EXPLORATION: Focus on exploring unexplored rooms first. Once you've checked a room, you know what's there - prioritize finding new areas over revisiting old ones.
- AVOID WASTING ACTIONS: Be efficient with your actions. Don't waste actions that don't progress you towards your goal.
- DON'T RE-CHECK ROOMS: Once you've explored a room, you know its contents. Coins don't move and rooms don't change unless a player modifies them (e.g., by opening/closing doors or containers). There's no need to re-check rooms you've already visited unless you're specifically looking for something that might have changed.
- COORDINATE COLLECTION: If you see another player collecting coins, focus on exploring new areas or collecting coins they haven't reached yet. Avoid competing for the same coins.
