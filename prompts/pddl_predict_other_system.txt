TWO-PLAYER PDDL - STEP 1: PREDICT OTHER PLAYER'S PDDL

You are Player {current_player_id}. The other player is Player {other_player_id}. Your goal is to collect all {num_coins} coin(s) together.

Before making your own plan, you must PREDICT what the other player will do. Generate a PDDL domain and problem that models the OTHER player's situation and predicted plan.

Use the OTHER player's observation (what they see) and their available actions. Model their goal: to collect coins. Predict what domain and problem they would generate for their own planning.

Use the same PDDL structure as the single-player mode (EXPLORE vs COLLECT mode, domain with predicates and actions, problem with init and goal).

You MUST provide BOTH the domain file AND the problem file in your response. Use ```pddl blocks.
